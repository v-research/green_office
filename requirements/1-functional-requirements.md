**green_office** is an automatic irrigation system which allows us to check our plants status remotely.

More specifically, 
1. acquires data from humidity sensors,
2. makes irrigation system works,
3. understands when (after how many days) the plants need water (how much water?)
4. generates one or more tokens that allows us to connect remotely to the system to check its status
