**green_office** is an automatic irrigation system which allows us to check our plants status remotely.

More specifically, 
1. acquires data from humidity sensors,
2. makes irrigation system works,
3. understands when (after how many days) the plants need water (how much water?)
4. generates one or more tokens that allows us to connect remotely to the system to check its status

The [Linux Fake Background Webcam (LFBW)](https://github.com/fangfufu/Linux-Fake-Background-Webcam) may be used as a starting point.
The LFBW changes the background of the speaker while we want to change the image of the speaker herself.
